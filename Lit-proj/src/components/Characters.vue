              Lev was born into the wealthy Calder family. His family's beliefs entitle him being tithed (A belief in purposely being unwound for god.) and that is all Lev had ever lived for. When he is on his way to be tithed it is the only thing he wants but when he meets Connor and Risa his view begin to change. For the first time he doesn't know where his life will go.
