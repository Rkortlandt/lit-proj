    <p class="card-bg-subtitle">Exposition</p>
    <p class="no-card">The Book introduces us to the bill of life. A bill that ensures life to the age of 13 and then you can be unwound by you parents or if you live in a state ward by the government until you turn 18. The book describes unwinding as living in a divided state. We meet the main characters, Connor, Risa, and Lev. Who all have been unwound for different Reasons (See the <a href="#/Characters" class="text-blue-600 underline">Characters</a> Page)</p>
    <p class="card-bg-subtitle">Rising Action</p>
    <p class="no-card">The Main Characters all meet up in a stroke of faith at a crash on the high way. Lev gets pulled out of his vehicle and taken as a hostage. Connor, Lev, and Risa Run into the woods. Lev thinking that he has been captured. Eventually while running from the police they end up at a high school with a baby. Where Lev (Who still wants to be "Tithed" or unwound) reports them for "Takeing him hostage" even though Connor and Risa are trying to save him. Connor and Risa meet Hanna a teacher who takes the baby and tells them of a safe house for unwinds at the antique shop.</p>
    <p class="no-card">Connor and Risa head to the Antique shop where they meet Sonia who invites them into the safe house. In the safe house they meet Hayden as well as Roland who is a sort of side antagonist. Over the next few weeks they move from safe house to safe house. There is rumor that at the end of line is a place called the graveyard.</p>
    <p class="card-bg-contrast">Meanwhile Lev meets a boy named Cyrus Finch, Who goes by Ci-Fy. We learn that Cyrus has part of an unwinds brain and instead of having a bunch of little pieces of brain (like normal) he has a whole lobe which makes him a little insane. The part of the Brain that is not his has a strong desire to go to Joplin Missouri so for better or for worse they make there way there. When they arrive things start to click into place for Cyrus. Joplin was his home. No, it was Tyler Walkers home. Although Cyrus is a minor character in Unwind he serves a propose. He shows reader the downfalls of unwinding and highlights another reason it should be abolished</p>
    <p class="no-card">Connor and Risa soon discover that Roland is what you would call "a pain in the arse" but Connor sees that Roland is more than just the playground bully. Finally they make it to the graveyard on a plane that is about to be decommissioned. They meet the Admiral who served in the Heartland. Connor is wary of him and doesn't like how his teeth are so shiny. They meet "The Goldens" who are the admiral's favorite's. We also here about Cleaver who is the Admirals helicopter Pilot, and Connor is concerned to learn that Roland is training with him. After a few weeks at the Graveyard Lev arrives on one of the incoming ships. How did he get there? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
    <p class="no-card">One day the admiral call's Connor up to his plane (They live in the decommissioned planes of the graveyard) an old Air Force one. </p>
