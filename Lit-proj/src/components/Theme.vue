  <p class="card-bg-title">Theme</p>
  <p class="no-card">The theme of Unwind is that all Humans should be valued. Another theme is when is someone considered living? Both of these themes are tied closely to abortion, the book generally takeing the stance that unwinding is a far worse fate than abortion. But it also doest suggest that it is right to abort. It is kind of an awkward Pro-abortion and Anti-abortion stance at the same time.</p>
  <p class="no-card">Regarding the theme of when someone is living the topic is discussed by the characters many times. We see the heartbreaking moments as Roland loses parts of his brain piece by piece and loses his ability to think he still exists but is he still living? The book also discusses the idea of a soul and if it is possible to unwind a soul. The book never really answers this question but it does make you think.</p>
