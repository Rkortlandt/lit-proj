    <p class="no-card">Unwind takes place in the near future. After a Civil war in America over abortion rights. The war (known as the Heartland war) is bloody. But a light shines at the end of the tunnel, and it's not a very nice light. Unwinding is invented which is the process of dissecting someone and reusing there parts without them being technically “Dead”. Unwinding ends the war, and the bill of life is enacted.</p>

          “... on the condition that the child’s life doesn’t “technically” end.”
